\chapter{Deployment Process}
During development, the application would be deployed to both the emulator and the physical device used for testing by the means of the aiStarter application that is to be used with App Inventor. When testing features, and especially during the transition between screens, I noticed that the transitions would take a long time to process, and I was afraid that the problem would persist when the application would be installed from an .apk file.

When I deemed the application ready to be deployed, I decided to store it in a public via link folder in my Google Drive, since I didn't have the intent of making it available to the general public and only wanted it to be available for presenting and for evaluation.

The application can be found in the following folder:
\href{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HNkbFOtjvBkk_PaII-yi2_qwW6sVlULS}{Google Drive Folder}

Also, after getting the application installed on my device through the .apk file, I noticed that when using it the problem of transitions taking a long time had disappeared, which for me was a relief.
