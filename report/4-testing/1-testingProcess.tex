\chapter{Testing Process}
Most of the application was tested as features were being developed. As soon as one feature would be implemented, such as the links between the different screens, I would connect either the emulator or my physical device to the development environment and test the feature to make sure of the following points:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The application would behave in a predictable manner
  \item The UI transitions and data displayed were correct
  \item No errors would be thrown
  \item The calculations were correct
\end{itemize}

Whenever there would be errors, I would analyse them and fix them before moving to the next feature.
