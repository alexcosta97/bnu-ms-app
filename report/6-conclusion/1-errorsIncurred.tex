\chapter{Errors Incurred}

Throughout the development of this application, I came over the following problems and errors:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Limited data storage possibilities
  \item Limited UI possibilities
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Label items weren't clickable
    \item Impossibility to dinamically populate screens
  \end{itemize}
  \item Incorrect display of data
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Impossibility to format the display of data inside ListView to get it to span throughout the whole element's horizontal space
  \end{itemize}
  \item Issues with passing of parameters
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Parameters not being registered correctly blocking the population of data
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Whilst some problems had an easy fix, like the solution for storing the data or customizing button elements to resemble the layout with label elements, some other issues couldn't be fixed on time for the deadlines or are too complicated to be resolved with App Inventor, such as the impossibility to dinamically populate screens, or the impossibility to format the data inside a ListView element so that it occupies all the available horizontal space for that index.
