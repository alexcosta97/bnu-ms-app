\chapter{Learning Outcomes}
Throughout the development of the application and the project, I learned the following things, both related to mobile applications development or as transferable skills:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Have a better understanding of the limitations of mobile applciations development
  \item Have a better grasp of the visual design sacrifices that need to be made in order to provide a better user experience
  \item Learn and apply project management techniques
  \item Prioritise tasks and adapt goals to meet deadlines
\end{itemize}

I also noted some mistakes that I made throughout the development of the project that I will try to avoid next time I am faced with such an imposing project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Start working earlier on
  \item Give myself more time to complete tasks
\end{itemize}

Overall, I enjoyed doing this project and think that I learned a lot whilst doing it, especially considering it was my first time using App Inventor to build an Android application and that even though I had studied project management techniques I had never applied them to a project that I actually had to do and work on.
