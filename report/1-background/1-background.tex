\chapter{Background to the App Idea}
I have many times tried to control my budget and find ways to manage my money more efficiently and tried different methods to do so, from the basic pen and paper to apps that use APIs to connect to my bank account to get information about how I spend my money.

Oftentimes I found the idea of an app like that very good at the beginning and set my goals for my budget but always end up either stopping using the app after a little while or not using at all to start with.

With that in mind, I have gotten the idea to build my own budget planner app as the project for this module. It won't be anything extremely complex like the app I once used that connects to my bank account's API, but that will be efficient when it comes to keep me on track and make sure that I make daily use of it.

My main ideas for the app are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Using available statistics for average spend, set a first draft of a budget for the user based on their income
  \item Allow the user to customize the automatically set budget to their needs, and do so anytime they need to do so
  \item Keep track of how much the user has been saving on a daily basis by doing a daily budget and how much the user has managed to save out of it
  \item Regularly remind users to input their expenses data, especially at times where the user usually makes them (e.g. lunch time)
  \item Tell the user through notifications how much they have saved in order to incentivate them to continue to use the app.
\end{enumerate}
