\chapter{Background to the App Idea}
I have many times tried to control my budget and find ways to manage my money more efficiently and tried different methods to do so, from the basic pen and paper to apps that use APIs to connect to my bank account to get information about how I spend my money.

Oftentimes I found the idea of an app like that very good at the beginning and set my goals for my budget but always end up either stopping using the app after a little while or not using at all to start with.

With that in mind, I have gotten the idea to build my own budget planner app as the project for this module. It won't be anything extremely complex like the app I once used that connects to my bank account's API, but that will hopefully help me keep track of my own expenses in an efficient manner.

My main ideas for the app are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Allow the user to input and customize their budget
  \item Allow the user to enter, modify and delete their expenses
  \item Allow the user to input their income and their pay day
  \item Tell the users how much they have been saving, in a daily, monthly and overall basis
  \item Separate the expenses into different categories so the user can adjust budgets more adequately
  \item Track daily expenses by calculating a daily spend budget and reducing the expenses made that day from it
\end{enumerate}
