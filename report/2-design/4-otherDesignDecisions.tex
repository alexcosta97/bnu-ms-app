\chapter{Other Design Decisions}
In order to not only facilitate the programming of the application but also to make calculations and the amount of processing easier, the following decisions had to be made:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Assume that all months are 30 days long for the calculation of the daily spend allowance
  \item Store the pay day as a number instead of a date and compare it to the current day through formatting the current date and time instant to only display the day in a single number
\end{itemize}
